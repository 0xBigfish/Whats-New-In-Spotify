# add playlist and artist URIs here (format: <name> = <URI> )

# everything from "#" to the end of the line WON'T be read by the script, use it to add comments if you want

# HOW TO GET A URI:
# In order to get a playlist's or artists URI simply the three dots next to playlist / artist, go to "share" and click
# "copy Spotify URI".
#
# To add a playlist or artist to this list simply paste it somewhere in this file in this format: <name> = <URI>
# where <name> is the name of playlist / artist (or a custom name you chose) and <URI> is the corresponding Spotify URI
# ONLY ONE pair of <name> = <URI> will be read per line
# 
# It doesn't matter where you paste this, but I do recommend to paste playlists under ##Playlists and aristst under ##Artists. This
# way the file is easy to read and understand.
